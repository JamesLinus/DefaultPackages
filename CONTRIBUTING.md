## Before creating a new issue

*   Make sure it isn't a package that's causing the bug. Start with a [clean profile](http://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/revert.html) if you need.

    This repo is for *Sublime Text-related* bugs only. If your issue is related to a specific package or plugin, submit your report to that package's repository instead.
*   Search for the bug [here](https://github.com/SublimeTextBugs/DefaultPackages/search?q=&type=Issues) to see if an issue like yours already exists. You may use labels for filterting the [issue list](https://github.com/SublimeTextBugs/DefaultPackages/issues) by clicking any of these related to the problem you want to report.


## Filing a bug

1.  Start with a descriptive but concise **subject** that quickly and uniquely identifies the problem.
*   Write a **summary** of the problem in a few lines, giving an idea of what the issue is about.
*   Then, **describe** the bug with all the information you can give.
    Be sure to include the following information:
    * Operating System
    * The version of Sublime Text that you're using
    * Any related software which may cause ST to act strangely

    Also keep in mind to clearly separate fact from speculation.
*   Try to find a way to **reproduce** the problem and write down precise steps. It might be useful to include a code example for this. **if a specific code produces the bug, try to share the code**
*   Workarounds or other related tips on how to avoid the issue are welcome.

We won't slaughter you if you can't fulfill all of these steps but prepare to answer a few question if we think we're lacking information.

If you want to be really good at reporting bugs you can also read [these guidelines](https://landfill.bugzilla.org/bugzilla-tip/page.cgi?id=bug-writing.html) for bugzilla bugs.


## Filing an enhancement or a feature request

1.  Start with a descriptive but concise **subject** that quickly and uniquely identifies the issue.
*   Explain briefly what the enhancement is and why you think it would be useful.
*   Provide any other necessary or useful information regarding your issue, such as (code) examples or related links.

Note: "enhancements" are modifications to existing behaviour as opposed to something entirely new.
